The application architecture follows a modular separation of concerns:
- index.html: HTML structure (855 lines)
- style.css: CSS styling (609 lines)
- app.js: JavaScript logic (2148 lines)

Note: index_original_backup.html is retained for reference but is not used in the current implementation.

## System Architecture

The web dashboard communicates with the data logger hardware through the MQTT broker:

```
Web Browser (Dashboard) ←→ MQTT Broker (WebSocket Port 8083) ←→ ESP32 Gateway ←→ STM32 Sensor Node
         ↓
Firebase Cloud Database (Optional)
```

Communication protocols:
- HTTP/HTTPS: Static dashboard file delivery
- WebSocket (MQTT): Real-time bidirectional sensor data and control commands
- Firebase API: Cloud data persistence and historical retrieval

## Configuration

### Running the Web Server

The dashboard consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served by any web server.

#### Method 1: Python HTTP Server (Recommended for Development)

```bash
cd web
python -m http.server 8080
```

Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8080

#### Method 2: Node.js HTTP Server

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
```

#### Method 3: PHP Built-in Server

```bash
php -S localhost:8080
```

### Configuring MQTT Connection

Click the settings gear icon in the dashboard and configure:

- MQTT Broker IP Address: IP address of the Mosquitto broker (example: 192.168.1.100)
- WebSocket Port: MQTT WebSocket port (default: 8083)
- WebSocket Path: MQTT WebSocket endpoint path (default: /mqtt)
- Username: MQTT authentication username
- Password: MQTT authentication password

Click Save Configuration to apply settings.

### Configuring Firebase (Optional)

For cloud data persistence, configure Firebase settings:

- Database URL: Firebase Realtime Database URL (example: https://your-project.firebaseio.com/)

## MQTT Topic Structure

The dashboard subscribes to and publishes messages on the following MQTT topics:

### Subscribed Topics (Dashboard receives data)

| Topic | Data Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `datalogger/esp32/sensor/data` | JSON | Complete sensor data with timestamp and mode |
| `datalogger/esp32/status` | JSON | System status including relay and WiFi state |
| `datalogger/esp32/relay/state` | String | Relay state changes (ON/OFF) |

Example sensor data message:
```json
{
  "mode": "PERIODIC",
  "timestamp": 1729699200,
  "temperature": 25.50,
  "humidity": 60.00
}
```

Example status message:
```json
{
  "device": "ON",
  "periodic": "OFF",
  "wifi": "connected",
  "mqtt": "connected"
}
```

### Published Topics (Dashboard sends commands)

## Dashboard Features and Usage

### Real-Time Data Visualization

The dashboard displays two synchronized charts:
- Temperature chart (left): Shows temperature readings in degrees Celsius
- Humidity chart (right): Shows relative humidity percentage

Charts automatically update when new data is received via MQTT. Historical data points are limited to 50 entries per chart to maintain performance.

### Statistical Analysis

Current statistics displayed for each measurement:
- Current Value: Most recent sensor reading
- Minimum: Lowest recorded value in current session
- Maximum: Highest recorded value in current session
- Average: Mean of all recorded values in current session

Statistics reset when charts are cleared.

### Device Control Panel

**Relay Control**
- DEVICE ON button: Activates relay output (GPIO4 on ESP32)
- DEVICE OFF button: Deactivates relay output

**Measurement Control**
- PERIODIC button: Starts periodic measurements at configured interval
- SINGLE SHOT button: Requests single immediate measurement
- Interval selector: Choose sampling period from 1 second to 60 minutes

### Connection Status Monitoring

Status indicators show real-time connection state:
- MQTT Status: WebSocket connection to MQTT broker
- Firebase Status: Connection to Firebase cloud database

Color-coded messages in terminal display:
- Green: Successful operations
- Yellow: Warnings or state changes
- Red: Errors or connection failures
- Blue: Informational messages

### Data Management

- Clear Charts button: Removes all data points and resets statistics
- Firebase integration: Automatically stores data if configured
- Browser local storage: Saves MQTT and Firebase configuration settings

## Browser Requirements

Minimum supported browser versions:
- Chrome 80 or later
- Firefox 75 or later
- Safari 13 or later
- Microsoft Edge 80 or later

Required browser features:
- WebSocket API
- ES6 JavaScript support
- HTML5 Canvas element
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Local Storage API
- Fetch API

## Security Considerations

### Production Deployment Security

For production environments, implement the following security measures:

**Use Encrypted Connections**
```javascript
// Configure WebSocket Secure (WSS) instead of WS
const mqttBrokerUrl = 'wss://your-broker.example.com:443/mqtt';
```

**Enable TLS/SSL on MQTT Broker**
Configure Mosquitto with TLS certificates:
```
listener 8084
protocol websockets
cafile /path/to/ca.crt
certfile /path/to/server.crt
keyfile /path/to/server.key
```

**Implement Strong Authentication**
- Use strong passwords for MQTT broker authentication
- Consider implementing OAuth or JWT-based authentication
- Rotate credentials periodically

**Configure CORS Properly**
Restrict broker WebSocket access to authorized origins only.

**Input Validation**
All sensor data and user inputs are validated before processing.

**Rate Limiting**
Implement MQTT message rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Troubleshooting

### MQTT Connection Issues

**WebSocket Connection Failed**

Symptoms: Cannot connect to MQTT broker, connection timeout

Solutions:
- Verify MQTT broker is running and WebSocket listener is active on port 8083
- Check broker IP address and port configuration in dashboard settings
- Test WebSocket connectivity using browser developer console
- Verify firewall allows WebSocket connections on port 8083
- Check broker authentication credentials

Command to verify broker WebSocket listener:
```bash
netstat -tlnp | grep 8083
```

**CORS Errors**

Symptoms: Browser console shows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing errors

Solutions:
- Verify mosquitto.conf has proper WebSocket configuration
- For development, ensure broker allows connections from dashboard origin
- Check browser developer console for specific CORS error messages
- Verify mosquitto.conf includes WebSocket protocol listener

**Authentication Failures**

Symptoms: Connection rejected by broker

Solutions:
- Verify username and password in dashboard settings match broker configuration
- Check broker/config/auth/passwd.txt file contains correct credentials
- Ensure allow_anonymous is set to false in mosquitto.conf
- Test authentication with mosquitto_pub command line tool

### Data Display Issues

**Charts Not Updating**

Symptoms: No new data points appear on charts

Solutions:
- Check browser JavaScript console for errors
- Verify MQTT connection status indicator shows connected
- Confirm ESP32 is sending data (check ESP32 serial monitor)
- Verify correct MQTT topics are subscribed
- Check Chart.js library loaded successfully

**Missing Historical Data**

Symptoms: Firebase data not loading

Solutions:
- Verify Firebase configuration in dashboard settings
- Check Firebase database rules allow read/write access
- Confirm Firebase API key has proper permissions
- Test Firebase connectivity independently
- Check browser console for Firebase authentication errors

### Performance Issues

**High Memory Usage**

Solutions:
- Reduce maximum chart data points (default 50) in app.js
- Clear charts periodically to free memory
- Disable Firebase integration if not needed
- Close unused browser tabs

**Slow Chart Rendering**

Solutions:
- Reduce chart animation duration
- Lower periodic sampling frequency
- Implement data throttling for high-rate updates
- Use chart update without animation: `chart.update('none')`

## Firebase Data Structure

When Firebase integration is enabled, sensor data is stored in the following structure:

```json
{
  "datalogger": {
    "sensors": {
      "data": {
        "1729699200": {
          "temperature": 25.50,
          "humidity": 60.00,
          "timestamp": 1729699200,
          "mode": "PERIODIC"
        },
        "1729699205": {
          "temperature": 25.51,
          "humidity": 60.02,
          "timestamp": 1729699205,
          "mode": "PERIODIC"
        }
      }
    },
    "system": {
      "status": {
        "device": "ON",
        "periodic": "ON",
        "wifi": "connected",
        "mqtt": "connected",
        "lastUpdate": 1729699205
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each sensor data entry includes:
- temperature: Temperature reading in degrees Celsius (float)
- humidity: Relative humidity percentage (float)
- timestamp: Unix timestamp in seconds (integer)
- mode: Measurement mode (SINGLE or PERIODIC)

System status includes:
- device: Relay state (ON or OFF)
- periodic: Periodic measurement state (ON or OFF)
- wifi: WiFi connection status
- mqtt: MQTT connection status
- lastUpdate: Last update timestamp

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Typical Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Memory Usage | 10-15 MB |
| Network Bandwidth | 1-2 KB per minute at 1 Hz sampling |
| Firebase Storage | Approximately 1 MB per day |
| CPU Usage | Minimal impact with optimized rendering |
| Maximum Chart Points | 50 data points per chart |

Performance optimization tips:
- Limit chart data points to reduce memory usage
